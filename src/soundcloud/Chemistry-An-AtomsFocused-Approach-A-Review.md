The book adopts an atoms-focused approach that starts with the smallest particles and builds them into more complex structures. This approach helps students understand how the properties of substances are related to their atomic and molecular structures. The book also incorporates chemistry education research from co-author Stacey Lowery Bretz on how students construct and interpret multiple representations of chemistry concepts. The book uses clear visualization pedagogy that emphasizes the particulate nature of matter and helps students become expert problem solvers.
 
The book comes with a variety of learning tools and resources for students and instructors. Students can access an ebook version of the book that allows them to take notes, bookmark, search, and highlight. They can also use Smartwork5, an online homework platform that provides hints, feedback, and tutorials. Additionally, they can watch ChemTour animations that explain chemistry concepts with audio and visuals. Instructors can use an interactive instructor's guide that offers innovative ways to incorporate active learning pedagogy in the classroom. They can also use a test bank that contains multiple-choice and free-response questions aligned to the APÂ® curriculum framework.
 
Chemistry: An Atoms-Focused Approach is a comprehensive and engaging textbook that helps students learn chemistry at the micro, macro, and symbolic level. It is suitable for general chemistry courses at the college level or for APÂ® courses at the high school level.

Some of the features that make Chemistry: An Atoms-Focused Approach stand out from other textbooks are:
 
- The book uses a consistent and coherent framework that connects the three levels of chemistry: the particulate level, the macroscopic level, and the symbolic level. The book shows how these levels are interrelated and how they can be used to explain and predict chemical phenomena.
- The book uses a spiral approach that revisits key concepts and skills throughout the chapters. The book builds on students' prior knowledge and reinforces their understanding of core ideas. The book also provides opportunities for students to apply their knowledge to new situations and contexts.
- The book uses a variety of pedagogical tools and strategies to support students' learning and engagement. The book includes learning objectives, key terms, summaries, review questions, practice problems, worked examples, margin notes, conceptual questions, visualizing chemistry problems, projected visualization problems, molecular modeling problems, and more. The book also uses real-world applications and examples to illustrate the relevance and importance of chemistry.

Chemistry: An Atoms-Focused Approach is a well-written and well-designed textbook that offers students a solid foundation in chemistry. The book is based on sound research and best practices in chemistry education. The book is also supported by a rich array of online resources that enhance students' learning experience and outcomes.
